# Kannada_Morph_Analyzer
Requirements: Lttoolbox Apertium
Kannada Unicode to WX Converter
Dictionary data

We have used authentic Kannada dictionary from Kannada University, Hampi:

D. S. Rai and D. Peraje, Sankshipta Adhunika Kannada Nighantu (A Brief Lexicon
of Modern Kannada). Saujanya Prasaranga, Kannada Vishwa Vidyalaya, Hampi,
2013.

Paradigms are manually deduced and are fed into the Lttoolbox of Apertium which uses a FST for generating inflections for dictionary words
based on grammar rules fed into the system.
This work is purely for non-commercial research purposes and an attempt to promote morphological features in Kannada language.
